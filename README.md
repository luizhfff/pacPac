1. Describe your game and what the player can do in the game clearly.
<ANSWER> The game is about a character called "EatMan", who can move on screen using keyboard arrow keys and "eat" obstacles. Each obstacle returns one event. The silver coin gives 100 points to the player, the gold coin gives 500 points to the player. If the player eats a bomb, the game is over. Player has 30 seconds to get as much points as possible, after that game is over either. 

2. What are all of the controls for the game? What do I need to do to find/test every part of the game?
<ANSWER> Character is controlled with arrow keys. The game is about to eat coins as much as possible to score higher points.

3. What bugs or other problems are present?
<ANSWER> On my tests I didn't notice any bugs.

4. Did you use any outside code? This should include any code you did not write yourself. You will not receive a penalty if you did so, but you will not get credit for the outside code. If you have included outside code without reporting it honestly, it becomes a case of academic dishonesty.
<ANSWER> I didn't use any outside code. I only did searches on websites like W3School to find use cases that I need to create the game. I also used knowledge from the course (assignments and labs), adapted to this game.
